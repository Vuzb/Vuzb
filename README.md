## About Me

Hey, I’m Sepehr—a student who loves solving problems with code. I’ve put in serious hours working with **JavaScript**, **Python**, and **C++**, and I’m constantly experimenting with better ways to build fast, clean, and purposeful software.

I’m not trying to impress anyone—just focused on writing code that works, looks good, and feels right to use.

## What I Work With

- **Web Development**
  - JavaScript / React / Next.js
  - Tailwind / UI logic / clean component design

- **Backend & Automation**
  - Python scripting / FastAPI
  - Lightweight automations and tooling

- **Systems & Performance**
  - C++ for low-level tasks and optimization
  - DevOps basics / scripting for efficiency

## How I Think

I care about clarity, speed, and not overcomplicating things. Most of what I write is built with simplicity and scalability in mind—no unnecessary layers, no clutter.

If I’m not building, I’m probably rebuilding it better.

## Now

Currently exploring new stacks, refining design workflows, and just building for fun.
